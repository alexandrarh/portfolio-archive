Contains source code from original portfolio

## Credits
I got my inspiration from [Zac Holman](https://zachholman.com/), who created his template on R; I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to remove it from R (for some reason, R doesn't work on my computer)

Also usual credits to Googling things from websites like:

 - Geeks4Geeks
 - W3Schools
 - Web.dev
 - StackEdit.io (for helping write this README)
